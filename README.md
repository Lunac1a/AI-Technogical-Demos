# AI Technogical Demos
These demos contain a jupyte notebook with dataset or pictures, each demo presents a technology in Artificial Intelligence.

## Demo 1: A* Search
I completed A* algorithm to search for the shortest way from one city to another city, with dataset in the file.

## Demo 2: Simulated Annealing in TSP
I completed Simulated Annealing to solve the travelling salesman problem (TSP), with dataset in file.

## Demo 3: KNN Classifier
I used K-Nearest Neighbour to classify the iris data.

## Demo 4: FNN Classifier
I used the Diabetes Dataset to build a simple feedforward neural network (FNN) for a binary classification

## Demo 5: Reinforcement Learning
I uses Q-learning, a Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm, to solve a simple Gridworld problem
